# CleanRL 

This repository focuses on a clean and minimal implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms. The highlights features of this repo is:

* Most algorithms are self-contained in single files with a common dependency file [common.py](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/common.py) that handles different gym spaces.

* Easy logging of training processes using Tensorboard and Integration with wandb.com to log experiments on the cloud.

* Being able to debug in Pythonâ€™s interactive shell.

* Convenient use of commandline arguments for hyper-parameters tuning.
